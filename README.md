# 3DAimLab_Vision
Project to explore the computer vision field.

The idea is for the model to perform both random actions (helps with exploration) and model predicted actions to gradually improve the model.

The game is 3D Aim Trainer and the gamemode is Tile Survival.

In order to run this code you need to download interception and python-interception on your own.

Then you should be able to run the code.
The loading code is here for debug purpose if you need to find out what is going wrong, should be easily customizable.

If anything isn't clear open an issue I'll try to help. But this code is here more as an exemple of use for python-interception.
